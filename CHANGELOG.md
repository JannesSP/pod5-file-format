### Changed
- Fixed osx arm64 wheel compatibility for older python versions.
- Fixed EndReason type errors.
- Renamed `EndReason.name` to `EndReason.reason` to access the inner enum and added
`EndReason.name` as a property to return the string representation of this enum value.
- Fixed EndReason in pod5 to fast5 conversion.
- Removed deprecated `Writer` functions.
- `BaseRead`, `Read`, `CompressedRead`, `Calibration` and `Pore` dataclasses are now mutable.
- Added `Reader.__iter__` method.

## [0.1.2] - 2022-12-06
### Changed
- Optimised the file writing utilities

## [0.1.1] - 2022-12-06
### Changed
- Restricted exported boost dependencies of conan package to just the boost::headers component.

## [0.1] - 2022-12-02
### Changed
- Fixed name of internal utils - "pad_file".
- Fixed spelling of various internal variables.
- Documentation edits
- Deprecated `Writer` methods `add_read_object` and `add_read_objects` for `add_read` and `add_reads` respectively.
- `Writer.add_reads` now handles both `Read` and `CompressedRead`.

- Fixed `pod5 convert to_fast5`

## [0.0.43]
### Changed
- Reformat c++ code with more consistent format file.

## [0.0.42]
### Added
- Added `pod5` tools entry-point
- Added api to query file version information as written on disk.

### Changed
- Fixed signal_chunk_size type error in convert-from-fast5
- Replaced `ont_fast5_api` dependency with `vbz_h5py_plugin`
- Restructured Python packaging to include `lib_pod5_format` which contains the native bindings build from pybind11.
- `pod5_format` and `pod5_format_tools` are now pure python packages which depend on `lib_pod5_format`
- Python packages `pod5_format` and `pod5_format_tools` have been merged into single `pod5` pure-python package.
- `pod5-convert-from-fast5` `--output-one-to-one` reworked so that output files maintain the input structure making this argument more flexible and avoid filename clobbering.
- Added missing `lib_pod5.update_file` function to pyi.
- `pod5-convert-from-fast5` `output` now takes existing directories and
writes `output.pod5` (current behaviour) or creates a new file with the given name if it doesn't exist.
- Renamed arguments in tools relating to multi-processing / multi-threading from `-p/--processes` to the mode common `-t/--threads`.

## [0.0.41] - 2022-10-27
### Changed
- Fixed pod5-inspect erroring when loading data.
- Fixed issue where some files in between 0.34 - 0.38 wouldn't load correctly.

## [0.0.40] - 2022-10-27
### Changed
- Fixed migrating of large files from older versions.

## [0.0.39] - 2022-10-18
### Changed
- Fixed building against the c++ api - previously missing include files.

## [0.0.38] - 2022-10-18
### Removed
- Support for opening and writing "split" pod5 files. All API's now expect and return combined pod5 files.

### Changed
- All data in the read table that was previously contained in dictionaries of structs is now stored in the read table, or a new "run info" table.
    This change simplifies data access into the pod5 files, and helps users who want to convert the pod5 data to pandas or other arrow-compatible reader formats.
    Old data is migrated on load, and will continue to work, data can be permanently migrated using the tool `pod5-migrate`

## [0.0.37] - 2022-10-18
### Changed
- Updated Conan recipe to support building without specifying C++ standard version.

## [0.0.36] - 2022-10-07

## [0.0.34] - 2022-10-05
### Changed
- Modified `pod5_format_tools/pod5_convert_to_fast5.py` to separate `pod5_convert_to_fast5_argparser()` and `convert_from_fast5()` out from `pod5_convert_from_fast5.main()`.

## [0.0.33] - 2022-10-05
### Changed
- File version is now V2, due to the addition of `num_samples`.

### Added
- Added `num_samples` field to read table, containing the total number of samples a read contains. The field is filled in by API if it doesn't exist.

## [0.0.32] - 2022-10-03
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where multi-threaded access to a single batch could cause a crash discovered by dorado testing.
- Fixed help text in convert to fast5 script.
